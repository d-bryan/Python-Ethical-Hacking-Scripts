# Python-Ethical-Hacking-Scripts


I wanted to get more experience with Python as well as learn how the tools I use on CTFs work behind the scenes.

So I followed took a course and made: a Mac Changer, Network Scanner, ARP Spoofer, Packet Sniffer, DNS Spoofer, JavaScript Injector, ARP Spoof Detector, Keylogger, Backdoor, Web Crawler, brute force login program, and Vulnerability Scanner. 


I also added extra functionality to some of the programs and tailored it to my needs. Customizing it and adding more functionality helped a lot with my learning process. If you use it you may need to change some variables, and tailor it to suit your needs.
